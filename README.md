## **torch-spherical-harmonics**

Real spherical harmonics (RSH) in Cartesian form for PyTorch. The resulting source code is automatically created by converting optimized symbolic RSH expressions to PyTorch.

The following plot shows the first real spherical harmonics $Y_{nm}$ of degree $n$ and order $m$ as a function of polar coordinates $\theta \in [0,\pi]$ and $\phi \in [0,2\pi]$.
